### Structure

In the development of our Flutter project, we heavily relied on the Clean Architecture when structuring our codebase. We organized various features into separate folders, namely domain, data, and presentation, to facilitate effective management.

### Development

#### Test

```bash
# Test all
$ flutter test

# Test file
$ flutter test test/{file_name}
```

#### Lint

You can inspect the lint rules we have set up using the following commands:

```bash
flutter analyze
```

#### Pub run build

We aimed to minimize the time spent generating boilerplate using the build runner in Flutter. The packages dependent on the build runner include `go_router`, `riverpod`, and `freezed`. We recommend running the build runner in the background as you develop, following command below.

```bash
flutter pub run build_runner watch
```

This will minimize the time required to generate boilerplate code while you continue with your development.
